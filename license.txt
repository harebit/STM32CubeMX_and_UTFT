  UTFT.cpp - Multi-Platform library support for Color TFT LCD Boards
  Copyright (C)2015 Rinky-Dink Electronics, Henning Karlsen. All right reserved
  
  This library is the continuation of my ITDB02_Graph, ITDB02_Graph16
  and RGB_GLCD libraries for Arduino and chipKit. As the number of 
  supported display modules and controllers started to increase I felt 
  it was time to make a single, universal library as it will be much 
  easier to maintain in the future.

  Basic functionality of this library was origianlly based on the 
  demo-code provided by ITead studio (for the ITDB02 modules) and 
  NKC Electronics (for the RGB GLCD module/shield).

  This library supports a number of 8bit, 16bit and serial graphic 
  displays, and will work with both Arduino, chipKit boards and select 
  TI LaunchPads. For a full list of tested display modules and controllers,
  see the document UTFT_Supported_display_modules_&_controllers.pdf.

  When using 8bit and 16bit display modules there are some 
  requirements you must adhere to. These requirements can be found 
  in the document UTFT_Requirements.pdf.
  There are no special requirements when using serial displays.

  You can find the latest version of the library at 
  http://www.RinkyDinkElectronics.com/

  Commercial use of this library requires you to buy a license that
  will allow commercial use. This includes using the library,
  modified or not, as a tool to sell products.

  The license applies to all part of the library including the 
  examples and tools supplied with the library.
